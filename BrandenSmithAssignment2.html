		<b>Introduction</b> <br>
		<p> The purpose of this document is to show and explain my top three favorite HyperText Markup Language (HTML) tags.
			I am a Computer Science student at Saginaw Valley State University doing a HTML assignment for CIS 255.
		</p>

		<p><strong>&lt;h1&gt; to &lt;h6&gt;</strong>. The <strong>header</strong> tag is one of my favorite tags. 
			Although the header tag is very simple, I like it because it has six different sizes.
			This feature allows the designer to easily create a hierarchy of headers and formatting without compilicated styling, as you can see above.
		</p>
		
		<hr />
		
		<p><strong>&lt;ul&gt;</strong>. The <strong>unordered list</strong> tag is also a really cool tag.<br>
			Reasons:
		</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Appealing way to show a list.</li>
				<li>Bullets instead of numbers allow it to be unordered.</li>
				<li>Lists can go on...</li>
				<li>... and on...</li>
				<li>...and on.</li>
			</ul>

		<p><strong>&lt;a&gt;</strong>. According to Dr.George Corser in his essay <a target="_blank" href="https://csis.svsu.edu/~gpcorser/cis255/favoritetags.html">MY FAVORITE HTML TAGS</a>, the <strong>anchor</strong> tag "most fundamentally embodies the purpose of the World Wide Web: to enable documents to be linked to other documents."
			I couldn't agree more. The Web needs links to help us travel from one place to another, and links need the anchor tag in order to work.
			Anchor tags and links are very important for websites like <a target="_blank" href="https://www.google.com/">google.com</a> to exist.
		</p>

		<b>Conclusion</b> <br>
		<p>The header, unordered list, and anchor tags are three of my favorite tags because they
			are all very useful in their own ways. The header and unordered list tags are helpful when formatting
			or designing. While the anchor tag is a needed component for the Web to function the way it does.
