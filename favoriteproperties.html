		<h3>Introduction</h3>
		<div id="divintro"
				
				<p id = "intro">Hello, this is my website created by HTML and CSS. The purpose of this
				website is to show off and describe 5 interesting CSS properties. These properties may not be the most exciting ones, but they are all very useful in making an eye-pleasing website. Also, enjoy many other CSS properties that won't be explicitly mentioned below.

				show I can use Chrome Devtools.

				<p id="para2">
					<h4 id="colorprop">The Color Property.</h4> Although it is very simple, the color property takes a simple
					HTML site to the next level by just changing colors. The color property is easy to use and can make a big difference aesthetically.
					I prefer to use hexidecimal colors to get a wide variety, but there is multiple ways to change the color like saying just the name, RGB colors, or HSL.
				</p>
			</div>
			
			<div id=div3>
				<p id="para3">
					<h4>The Font-Family Property.</h4>
					This property is also very simple one, but is very effective. Changing fonts can really highlight and grab people's attention.
					The <strong id = "fonts">font-family property</strong> is pretty neat since you can put multiple font names in and if the first one does not exist in the browser, then it uses the second one, and so on.
					
				</p>
			</div>
			
			<div id=div4>
				<p id="para4">
						<h4>The Transform Property.</h4>
						Having the ability to scale, rotate, or skew things on the page is really cool and the transform property allows us to do that. Just hover over the below list items and check it out!
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li id="scale">Scale</li>
					<li id="rotate">Rotate</li>
					<li id="skew">Skew</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
		</div>
		<hr />
		<div id="wrapper2">
			<div id=div5>
				<p id="para5">
					<h4>The Opacity Property.</h4>The ability to make objects and text invisible, visible, and everything in between is very interesting.
					Setting the property to 1 means fully visible, 0.5 means 50% see-through, and then 0 would make the element truly transparent.
					Combined with a transition, you can see what opacity can do when you hover over the image in the top right.
					
				</p>
			</div>
			<div id=div6>
				<p id="para6">
					<h4>The Border-Radius Property.</h4>
					I love all the different properties that are available for borders, but I specifically
					chose border-radius because I think it can have the biggest effect to the appearance by changing the curvature of the border.
					The border-radius property can take in a few different combinations of inputs. For example, the above borders
					have a border-radius of 45px all the way around while these lower ones have a 15px and 50px on opposite corners.
